I’m right next to a bus stop that goes to Chatswood and on the opposite journey Ryde. It’s about a 3 minute walk to the pacific hwy so it’s also close to the buses that go to Mosman, Manly, North Sydney, Bondi Beach, Gladesville, Five Dock and the City.,If Bus isn’t your preferred method of transport then it takes about 10 minutes to walk down hill to Artarmon train station and 15 minutes to Chatswood station (although there are plenty of buses to Chatswood too).,I don’t drive so if you have a car there is a closed garage for you to use.,I’v lived here now for 5 years and absolutely love the place.,Iv decked out the living room to be a warm comfortable place. It’s got a big screen TV and I have PS4 so can watch Netflix, ABC and watch DVDs or Bluerays on. I have also seperate the living room into three spaces, TV area, a study nook(or dining area) and a large open space that would be good for yoga 🧘‍♀️,Iv also got a beautiful balcony I take care of that has various herbs and flowers. So if you like cooking with fresh ingredients you might find some there!,Talking of cooking the kitchen is fully furnished too. It’s got a gas stove and oven, I have a decent fridge in there and seperate cupboards for tea ☕️ and another as the pantry.,Now onto your room. Your room backs onto the appartments front lawn area and has lots of trees to keep your room private. Iv got a beautiful IKEA double wardrobe with glass sliding doors in there. The room can fit up to a queen.,Bathroom is shared and has a shower, bath and toilet.,There are shared laundry facilities within the apartment and came with a washing machine and a dryer.,So about me. I’m an early childhood teacher by trade. Iv just finished university (or at least I hope I have I’ll find out in December!😃) I’m a nerd at heart and enjoy Disney, Harry Potter, Sci-fi. I can be good for a chat and listen at the end of the day also cool with keeping my own space if that’s what you prefer.,Things about you if you want to apply:,I’m not too fussy about if you’re a male or female. Females I don’t care what age group you are but men need to be under 40. I am a strict non smoker and anyone applying must not smoke either. I’m looking for someone who is fairly tidy (at least in commen areas) and won’t mind helping with the cleaning. Rent can be payed either fortnightly or weekly, as long as it’s payed on time.,I have included bills in the rent but if you would prefer to pay bills as they came rent will be $280 p/w,I’m looking forward to hearing from you,Please use phone number at end of add to contact me as I don’t get notifications for this site when messages are sent.,My number is,******** 432,Kind regards,Jacqui",

There are double glazed windows with pretty good noise and temperature isolation. Also, one-minute walk from the bus stop as it's close to Parramatta Rd but not noisy as it is in the inner street. Walking distance to Sydney Uni, Glebe and Newtown.,The room is big enough for two people (bigger than it looks on the pictures) and it comes with a queen size bed and bedding and large built-in wardrobes. You'll have your own bathroom however the shower is shared between 2 rooms. Everyone in the house is working full-time and don't spend much time home. It's usually pretty quiet and there are no parties. There is no parking available if you have a vehicle.,Looking for a couple working full-time, tidy and respectful to common house-sharing rules. All bills are included and the bond is 2 weeks rent. Earliest moving in date is 29th of November. If you are interested and / or have any questions please send me a message and we can schedule a viewing and talk details.,Thanks guys!",

On the other hand, if you prefer to pay weekly, it'll be 250$ a week. So once you do the inspection, you can tell me what do you prefer!,The house is super quiet and chill, there are more flatmates, all super nice, but they all have private room, so it feels like is empty most of the time!,Please when applying, send also some info about you, is really important for my flatmates to know about a new person coming into the house!,Please reply to this ad or text me to ******9020,Cheers,,Jamie",

There's a liberal dose of Indian shops in the suburb for your grocery and lentil requirements. I am looking for individual professionals like IT/others or professionals. Min 6 months of stay reqd though 5 months could also be considered in special cases. I have been having mostly IT professionals from Indian subcontinent most of the time - however, I have no specific choices and all are welcome. Please text me if you are unable to get me on the mobile with your details.,Rent quoted above is for one person per wk (ie sharing the room with another IT guy mostly from India) and is inclusive of all bills except gas & energy @ of $14/wk together. That will be 189 14=203 per week. Std terms and condition apply. Independent room will come for $39/- more (ie: 189 39= $228/wk all inclusive). Standard terms and conditions apply. If two colleagues from the same company (back in India) working on the same project here share the room, then it will be $159/- per head per wk incldg all bills. I have been mostly having inmates from S.India (prefer vegetarians but not a must) but having said that I am open to anyone from the subcontinent. New arrivals on PR are also welcome. Please contact me (Kumar) on zero four zero one eight four eight five three five to discuss further. If I am busy at work pls leave your no and I will call u back once I a free. This may happen 3-4 hrs or 6 hrs later too. Pls do not reply to this email as I may not be able to respond promptly to it. You may also text me. Couples may also enquire but the rate will depend on the circumstances at the time of your enquiry.,The place is ready for occupying immediately. Look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you.,Regards,,Kumar",

We respect each other's privacy and try to make the house as homey and comfy as we could. House mates are all from different countries as we embrace culture variety and love a bit of difference. English is the only language spoken in the house. Currently we have 2 boys and 1 girl, all mature and self-efficient. We prefer the fourth housemate to be a girl, but can also take a boy. We try to keep the public space clean by taking turns to do chores, would expect you to do the same. Note: We have a lovely cat in the house, hope you don't mind. Also, the rent has all bills included.",

What makes this location special are a few things: If you are a student at UNSW or working at Prince of Wales hospital, you are a comfortable 10 mins walk to these places. There are 2 bus stops at our doorstep, and you have 12 buses that take you around to the city and beaches like Bondi, Coogee and Maroubra. It’s also 50 meters away from the Ritz Cinemas, so if you love your movies, you can pop down there 30 seconds before it starts. The Spot is a bustling community so you’ll find lots of great food, a few small bars and there is a cozy feel to this area.,A little bit more about your flatmates: The flat is home to international people - everyone is clean, nice and friendly - either working full time or studying full time at UNSW, their ages are 23 - 30. It has 4 rooms, 2 bathrooms, a fully furnished kitchen, high-speed wifi, laundry and lounge with TV & pretty much everything you may need to be comfortable.,About the room: This room is big and it’s fully furnished so all you need are bedsheets. It has a wardrobe for all your clothes and extra storage. You’ll have a desk and bedstand. $300 per week will include all the bills (wifi, laundry & utilities including the eletricity and water),I'm looking for people who are staying longer than 3 months and are ideally students at UNSW. Contact me to inspect or discuss more details about the double room. I will be more responsive if you contact me through my phone rather than messaging through gumtree.
